Is an understanding of probability a super power ?
================================================

This program simulates a probabilistic decision maker and a naive decision maker to see whose choice is better.
For more information see here :

First player (naive) picks a random choice from the list of choices available.
Second player (probablistic) chooses the choice which maximises his net expected benefit.


A few test run results :
========================

Naive player wallet : 166.0
Probabilistic player wallet : 786.0

-----------------------------------

Naive player wallet : 490.0
Probabilistic player wallet : 490.0

-----------------------------------

Naive player wallet : 636.0
Probabilistic player wallet : 704.0

-----------------------------------

I am yet to see an iteration where the naive player beats the probabilistic player.
